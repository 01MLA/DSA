 * LeetCode 547 â€“ Number of Provinces
 * <p>
 * Problem:
 * Given n cities, some are directly or indirectly connected.
 * A province is a group of connected cities with no connections outside.
 * Input: n x n matrix isConnected[i][j] = 1 if city i and j are directly connected.
 * Output: Total number of provinces.
